### Hi there, I'm Harry ... 👋 

An undergraduate at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, majored in Computer Science. 

I am highly interested in various fields in computer science, particularly in <ins>theoretical computer science (theory B)</ins> and in developing semantical best practices to program in a elegant and symmetric way. I am methodically experienced in developing and maintaining client/server apps and websites. I am also experienced in and currently exploring more about data mining, manipulation and visualization.

Flandia and 孔明亲 both are the nicknames I usually use for online surfing.

#### Why "Flandia"? 

It's from a old light novel... Flandre Scarlet? Almost, but no 😀.
