### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

Hey! I'm an undergraduate at HKUST majored in Computer Science, interested in art, computing and programming! 

Flandia Yingman and å­”æ˜Žäº² both are the nicknames I usually use for online surfing. Alternatively, feel free to call me by Harry if you feel that's better.

I am especially interested in developing semantical best practices to program in a elegant and symmetric way.

#### Why "Flandia Yingman"? 

It's from a old light novel... Flandre Scarlet? Almost, but no ðŸ˜€.
