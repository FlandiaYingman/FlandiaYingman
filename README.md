### Hi there 👋 

Hey! I'm **Flandia Yingman**, an undergraduate at HKUST in ENGG+AI (COMP+AI in the future), interested in art, computing and programming! 

**Flandia Yingman** and **孔明亲** both are the nicknames I usually use for online surfing. **Flandia Yingman** is mostly used on English websites, while **孔明亲** is more likely used on Chinese websites. By the way, my legal name is **LI, Yu Hong Harry**, and feel free to call me by it.

I love to make friends 👭! If you wish, just follow me on GitHub or open an issue in this repo!

#### Why "Flandia Yingman"? 

It's from a old light novel... Flandre Scarlet? Almost, but no 😀.

#### Why "孔明亲"? 

孔明 is my favorite anime character in a famous mobile game "Fate: Grand Order". While the suffix 亲 is used for calling intimates.
